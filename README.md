# ModelPredictiveControl.jl

This package is a proof of concept of interoperability to solve Stochastic
Optimization Problem. It implements a MPC solver, that solves stochastic
optimal control problem assuming that noises are deterministic.

It aims to be part of a broader package, built in a modular way.
